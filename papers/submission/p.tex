  \abstract{One vexing problem in cognition is the dramatic attenuation of
correlations among inhibition tasks that purportedly tap similar
underlying constructs. Individuals that show large Stroop effects, for
example, do not show any larger flanker or Simon effects than average
(Rey-Mermet et al., in press). A pressing question then is whether these
attenuated correlations reflect statistical considerations, such as a
lack of individual variability on tasks, or substantive considerations,
such as that inhibition is not a unified concept. One problem in
addressing this question is that researchers aggregate performance
across trials to tally individual-by-task scores, and the covariation of
these scores is subsequently studied much as it would be with classical
test theory. It is tempting to think that aggregation here is fine and
everything comes out in the wash, but as shown, it renders
classical-test-theory concepts of reliability, effect size and
correlation deeply flawed. We propose an alternative psychometrics of
task performance that is based on accounting for trial-by-trial
variability along with the covariation of individuals' performance
across tasks. The implementation is through common Bayesian hierarchical
models, and this treatment rescues classical concepts of effect size,
reliability, and correlation for studying individual differences with
experimental tasks. We show using recent data from Hedge et al. (2018)
that there is Bayes-factor support for a lack of correlation between the
Stroop and flanker task. This support for a lack of correlation
indicates a psychologically relevant result---Stroop and flanker
inhibition are seemingly unrelated, contradicting unified concepts of
inhibition.}

In individual-differences studies, a number of variables are measured
for each individual. The goal is to decompose the covariation among
these variables into a lower-dimensional, theoretically-relevant
structure (Bollen, 1989; Skrondal \& Rabe-Hesketh, 2004). Critical in
this endeavor is understanding the psychometric properties of the
measurements. Broadly speaking, variables used in individual-difference
studies come from the following three classes: The first is the class of
rather natural and easy-to-measure variables such age, weight, and
gender. The second is the class of \emph{instruments} such as
personality and psychopathology instruments. Instruments have a fixed
battery of questions and a fixed scoring algorithm. Most instruments
have been benchmarked, and their reliability has been well established.
The final class of variables is performance on experimental tasks. These
experimental tasks are often used to assess cognitive abilities in
memory, attention, and perception.

On the face of it, individual-difference researchers should be sanguine
about using scores from experimental tasks. For one, many of these tasks
are robust in that the effects are easy to obtain in a variety of
circumstances. Take, for example, the Stroop task, which may be used as
a measure of inhibition. The Stroop effect is so robust, it is
considered universal (Haaf \& Rouder, 2017; MacLeod, 1991). Another
advantage is that many of these tasks have been designed to isolate
specific cognitive processes. The Stroop task, for example, requires
participants to inhibit the prepotent process of reading. Third, because
these tasks are laboratory based and center on experimenter-controlled
manipulations, they often have a high degree of internal validity.
Fourth, because these tasks are used so often, there is usually a large
literature about them to guide implementation and interpretation. It is
no wonder they have become popular in the study of individual
differences.

Yet, there has been a wrinkle in the setup. As it turns out, these
task-based measures correlate with one another far less than one might
think \emph{a priori.} The best example of these wrinkles is perhaps in
the individual-differences study of inhibition tasks (Friedman \&
Miyake, 2004; Ito et al., 2015; Pettigrew \& Martin, 2014; Rey-Mermet,
Gade, \& Oberauer, 2018; Stahl et al., 2014). In these large-scale
individual-differences studies, researchers correlated scores in a
variety of tasks that require inhibitory control. An example of two such
tasks are the Stroop task (Stroop, 1935) and the flanker task (Eriksen
\& Eriksen, 1974). Correlations among inhibition tasks are notoriously
low; most do not exceed .2 in value. The Stroop and flanker tasks, in
particular, seemingly do not correlate at all (Hedge, Powell, \& Sumner,
2018; Rey-Mermet et al., 2018; Stahl et al., 2014). These low
correlations are not limited to inhibition tasks. Ito et al. (2015)
considered several implicit attitude tasks used for measuring implicit
bias. Here again, there is surprisingly little correlation among tasks
that purportedly measure the same concept.

Why correlations are so low among these tasks is a mystery (Hedge et
al., 2018; Rey-Mermet et al., 2018). After all, these tasks are robust,
easy-to-obtain, and seemingly measure the same basic concepts. There are
perhaps two leading explanations: One is that the problem is mostly
statistical. High correlations may only be obtained if the tasks are
highly reliable, and low correlations are not intepretable without high
reliability. Hedge et al. document a range of test-retest reliabilities
across tasks, with most tasks having reliabilities below .7 in value,
and some tasks having reliabilities below .4 in value. In effect, the
problem is that people simply don't vary enough in some tasks given the
resolution of the data to document correlations. The second explanation
is that the lack of correlation is substantive. The presence of low
correlations in large-sampled studies means that the tasks are truly
measuring different sources of variation. In the inhibition case, the
ubiquity of low correlations in large-sample studies has led Rey-Mermet
et al. (2018) to make a substantive claim that the psychological concept
of inhibition is not unified at all.

Researchers typically use classical test theory, at least implicitly,
when studying individual differences. They make this choice when they
tally up an individual's data into a performance score. For example, in
the Stroop task, we may score each person's performance by the mean
difference in response times between the incongruent and congruent
trials. Because there is a single performance score per person per task,
tasks are very much treated as instruments. When trials are aggregated
into a single score, the instrument (or experiment) is a \emph{test} and
classical test theory serves as the analytic framework.

The unit of analysis in classical test theory is the test, or in our
case, the experimental task. Reliability and effect size, for example,
are assigned to the task itself and not to a particular sample or a
particular sample size. For instance, when a test developer states that
an instrument has test-retest reliability of .80, that value holds as a
population truth for all samples. We may see more noise if we
re-estimate that value in smaller samples, but, on whole, the underlying
population value of an instrument does not depend on the researcher's
sample size. We call this desirable property \emph{portability.}

We may contrast classical test theory to item-response theory (Lord \&
Novick, 1968). In item-response theory, the main unit of analysis is the
item rather than the test. Properties of the test, say reliability and
correlation, are replaced with properties of items, say item difficulty
and item disciminability. Yet, for tasks, where items are trials, item
difficulty and discriminability are not as helpful as concepts of
reliability and correlation. It is no surprise, therefore, that
researchers tend to use classical test theory, with its focus on the
task rather than the trial, to conceptualize individual differences in
tasks.

The main problem with using classical test theory, however, is that
portability is grossly violated. Concepts of reliability and effect
sizes within a task and correlations across tasks are critical functions
of sample sizes (Green et al., 2016). As a result, different researchers
will be estimating different truths when they invariably have different
sample sizes. We show how dramatically portability is violated in
practice, and how much these violations affect the interpretability of
classical statistics.

In this paper, we gain portability in experimental tasks by using a
straightforward hierarchical model to account simultaneously for
trial-by-trial variability, session variability, and individuals'
variability. The outputs are the estimates of individuals' effects,
variability in these effects, and shared covariation of these effects
across tasks. These outputs are portable across different sample sizes
including different numbers of trials per participant and different
numbers of participants. Hence, they preserve their meaning across
different studies and are broadly interpretable. This enhanced
interpretability licenses their use in addressing the low-correlation
mystery.

The application of hierarchical models to trial-by-trial performance
data in experimental tasks is not new. Previous applications in
individual-differences research include Schmiedek, Oberauer, Wilhelm,
SÃ¼ÃŸ, \& Wittmann (2007) and Voelkle, Brose, Schmiedek, \& Lindenberger
(2014). Moreover, trial-by-trial hierarchical modeling is well known in
cognitive psychology (Lee \& Webb, 2005; Rouder \& Lu, 2005) and
linguistics (Baayen, Tweedie, \& Schreuder, 2002). That said, to our
knowledge, using hierarchical models to make classical test-theory
concepts portable in experimental settings is novel. It is tasty,
low-hanging fruit on the methodological tree.

\section{The Dramatic Failure of
Portability}\label{the-dramatic-failure-of-portability}

In classical test theory, an \emph{instrument}, say a depression
inventory, is a fixed unit. It has a fixed number of questions that are
often given in a specific order. When we speak of portability, we speak
of porting characteristics of this fixed unit to other settings, usually
to other sample sizes in similar populations. In experimental tasks, we
have several different sample sizes. One is the number of individuals in
the sample; others are the numbers of trials each individual completed
within the various conditions in the task. We wish to gain portability
across both of these sample-size dimensions. For example, suppose one
team runs 50 people each observing 50 trials in each condition and
another team runs 100 people each observing 25 trials in each condition.
If measures of reliability and effect size are to be considered a
property of a task, then these properties should be relatively stable
across both teams. Moreover, if performance correlated with other
variables, portability would mean that the correlation is stable as
well.

But standard psychometric measures that are portable for instruments
fail dramatically on tasks. To show this failure, we reanalyze data from
a few tasks from Hedge et al. (2018). Hedge et al. compiled an
impressively large data set. They asked individuals to perform an
exceptionally large number of trials on several tasks. For example, in
their Stroop task, participants completed a total of 1440 trials each.
The usual number for individual-differences studies is on the order of
10s or 100s of trials each. Moreover, Hedge et al. explicitly set up
their design to measure test-retest reliability. Individuals performed
720 trials in the first session, and then, three-weeks later, performed
the remaining 720 trials in a second session. Here, we use the Hedge et
al. data set to assess conventional measures of effect size and
reliability are dependent on the number of trials per condition.

The following notation is helpful for specifying the conventional
approach to effect size and reliability. Let \(\bar{Y}_{ijk}\) be the
mean response time for the \(ith\) individual in the \(j\)th session
(either the first or second) in the \(k\)th condition. For the Stroop
task, the conditions are congruent (\(k=1\)) or incongruent (\(k=2\)).
Effects in a session are denoted \(d_{ij}\). These are the differences
between mean incongruent and congruent response times:

\begin{equation} \label{samp.eff}
d_{ij}=\bar{Y}_{ij2}-\bar{Y}_{ij1}. 
\end{equation}

The effect per individual can be averaged across sessions and denoted
\(\bar{d}_{i}\). The grand mean effect is just the mean of these
individual effects; the effect size is just the ratio of this grand mean
to the standard deviation of these effects, i.e.,
es\(=\)mean(\(\bar{d}_{i}\))\(/\)sd(\(\bar{d}_{i}\)). The test-retest
reliability is the correlation of individuals' effect scores for the
first session (\(j=1\)) to the second session (\(j=2\)).

Figure~\ref{fig:portability} shows a lack of portability in these
measures. We randomly selected different subsets of the Hedge et al.'s
data and computed effect sizes and test-retest reliabilities. We varied
the number of trials per condition per individual from 20 to 400, and
for each level, we collected 100 different randomly-chosen subsets. For
each subset, we computed effect size and reliability, and plotted are
the means across these 100 subsets. The line denoted \enquote{S} shows
the case for the Stroop task, and both effect size and reliability
measures increase appreciably with the number of trials per condition
per individual. The line denoted \enquote{F} is from Hedge et al.'s
flanker task, and the results are similar. In fact, these increases with
the number of replicates are a general property of tasks. Measures that
are treated as properties of the task are critically tied to sample
sizes. In summary, classical measures are portable when applied to
instruments because the numbers of items are fixed. They are importable
when applied to task performance where the number of trials per
individual will vary across studies.

size.}
\end{figure}

We think the above results may be surprising. The critical and outsized
role of replicates is seemingly under appreciated. Many researchers are
quick to highlight the numbers of individuals in studies. You may find
this number repeatedly in tables, abstracts, method sections, and
sometimes in general discussions. Researchers do not, however, highlight
the number of replicates per condition per individual. These numbers
rarely appear in abstracts or tables; in fact, it usually takes careful
hunting to find them in the method section if they are there at all. And
researchers are far less likely to discuss the numbers of replicates in
interpreting their results. And yet, as shown above, this number of
replicates is absolutely critical in understanding classical results.

One approach is to ask, \enquote{what is an appropriate number of
replicates?} (Hedge et al., 2018). This approach, however, strikes us as
unfortunate for studying individual differences because whatever the
number, the meaning of reliability, correlation, and effect size is
still tied to that number. Instead, a better approach is to strive for
portability---the meaning of reliability, correlation and effect size
should be independent of the number of replicates. We use simple
hierarchical statistical models to make these quantities portable. Our
approach is to consider the effects sizes, reliabilities, and
correlations in the large-sample limit of trials per individual. While
in reality individuals perform finite trials, we may use statistical
models to query what may reasonably happen in the limit. And estimates
of these values in the limit become portable estimates of effect sizes,
reliabilities, and correlations. Low numbers of replicates certainly
affect the quality of the estimates, but the true value---the value
being estimated---does not change with the number of replicates.

\section{A Hierarchical Model}\label{a-hierarchical-model}

Portability may be gained by using rather ordinary hierarchical models
to account for trial-by-trial variation and individual variation
simultaneously.

\subsection{Model specification}\label{model-specification}

The following univariate notation is used: Subscripts are used to denote
individuals, tasks, conditions, and replicates. Let \(Y_{ijk\ell}\)
denote the \(\ell\)th observation for the \(i\)th individual in the
\(j\)th task and \(k\)th condition. Observations are usually performance
variables, and in our case, and for concreteness, they can be response
times on trials. For now, we model response times in just one task, and
in this case, the subscript \(j\) may be omitted. Consider a trial-level
base model: \[
Y_{ik\ell} \sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_{ik},\sigma^2),
\] where \(\mu_{ik}\) is the true mean response time of the \(i\)th
person in the \(k\)th condition and \(\sigma^2\) is the true
trial-by-trial variability. It is important to differentiate between
true parameter values like \(\mu_{ik}\) and their sample estimates.

We develop this model for the Stroop task. In this task and tasks like
it, the key contrast is between the congruent (\(k=1\)) and incongruent
(\(k=2\)) conditions. This contrast is embedded in a model where each
individual has an average speed effect, denoted \(\alpha_i\), and a
Stroop effect, denoted \(\theta_i\): \[
Y_{ik\ell} \sim \mbox{Normal}(\alpha_{i}+x_k\theta_{i},\sigma^2),
\] where \(x_1=-1/2\) and \(x_2=1/2\).

The goal then is to study \(\theta_i\), the \(i\)th person's Stroop
effect size. In modern mixed models, individual's parameters
\(\alpha_i\) and \(\theta_i\) are considered latent traits for the
\(i\)th person, and are modeled as random effects: \[
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_i &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_\alpha,\sigma^2_\alpha,\\
\theta_i &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_\theta,\sigma^2_\theta),
\end{aligned}
\] where \(\mu_\alpha\) and \(\mu_\theta\) are population means and
\(\sigma^2_\alpha\) and \(\sigma^2_\theta\) are population variances.

The above mixed model is simple and it may be implemented in frequentist
or Bayesian frameworks. We use the Bayesian framework here because we
are more comfortable with the intellectual commitments made in Bayesian
probability than in frequentist probability (see, for example, Edwards,
Lindman, \& Savage, 1963). For estimation, the choice of framework
hardly matters, and the resulting analyses are by-and-large the same
regardless of how one implements them. The key feature here is the
hierarchical or mixed nature of the model. This feature is critical for
gaining portability, and the portability from the hierarchical
specification holds in both Bayesian and frequentist contexts.\footnote{The
  full Bayesian specification of the model comes from Haaf \& Rouder
  (2017) and is as follows. Let \(g_\alpha=\sigma^2_\alpha/\sigma^2\)
  and \(g_\theta=\sigma^2_\theta/\sigma^2\). Then: \[
  \begin{aligned}
  \pi(\mu_\alpha,\sigma^2) &\propto 1/\sigma^2,\\
  \mu_\theta & \sim \mbox{Normal}(0,g_{\mu_\theta}\sigma^2),\\
  g_\alpha & \sim \mbox{inverse-$\chi^2$}(1,r^2_\alpha),\\
  g_\theta & \sim \mbox{inverse-$\chi^2$}(1,r^2_\theta),\\
  g_{\mu_\theta} & \sim \mbox{inverse-$\chi^2$}(1,r^2_{\mu_\theta}),
  \end{aligned}
  \] where inverse-\(\chi^2\)(a,b) is a scaled inverse chi-squared
  distribution with \(a\) degrees-of-freedom and a scale of \(b\) (see
  Gelman, Carlin, Stern, \& Rubin, 2004). The following settings are
  used \(r_\alpha=\) 1, \(r_{\mu_\theta}=\) 0.25, and \(r_\theta=\)
  0.17. The prior settings have only marginal effects on parameter
  estimates as the priors are relatively diffuse and the data are
  numerous.}

\subsection{Hierarchical Regularization and the Portability of Effect
Size}\label{hierarchical-regularization-and-the-portability-of-effect-size}

The conventional analysis of the Stroop task centers on sample means
aggregated over trials. The critical quantity is
\(d_i=\bar{Y}_{i2}-\bar{Y}_{i1}\), the observed Stroop effect for the
\(i\)th individual. How does \(d_i\) compare to model-based estimates of
effects, \(\theta_i\)? Figure~\ref{fig:oneBlockEst} shows the comparison
for a subset of Stroop data in Hedge et al. (2018). We see that the
Bayesian estimates are smoother and far less variable than sample means.
This is an example of the benefits of regularization from hierarchical
models (Efron \& Morris, 1977), and they hold broadly (Gelman et al.,
2004; Lehmann \& Casella, 1998).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{p_files/figure-latex/oneBlockEst-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:oneBlockEst}Estimates of individual's Stroop effect from
one block of data. The estimates that have greater variability are
sample effects; the smoothed estimates are from the hierarchical model.}
\end{figure}

Just because the model-based estimates are smoother and there is less
individual variation doesn't mean they are better. The better estimates
are the ones closer to the true latent values! Here, we follow the
demonstration of Efron \& Morris (1977), a delightful paper that
illustrated the gain in accuracy with regularization from hierarchical
models. Efron \& Morris (1977) is written for a general audience, and
the goal was to predict the baseball hitting averages of select players
using their first 50 at bats. In one case, Efron and Morris used the
observed proportion of hits after 50 at bats, in the other they used a
hierarchical model similar to ours above. They found that the
hierarchical model substantially outperformed the observed-proportion
approach in predicting the end-of-season batting average for each
player.

We can do the same with Hedge et al.'s Stroop data. The estimates in
Figure~\ref{fig:oneBlockEst} were from a single block of 144 trials per
participant. Hedge et al. ran 10 such blocks distributed across two
sessions, and we may ask how well the estimates from one of the blocks
predict the whole 10-block set. Figure~\ref{fig:efron}, the style of
which is borrowed from Efron and Morris, shows the sample estimates from
one block (bottom row), the regularized model estimates from the same
block (middle row), and the sample estimates from all ten blocks (top
row). The shrinkage toward the grand mean in hierarchical models is
evident, and it is about right to bring the variability of the
model-based estimates from one block in line with that from all ten
blocks.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{p_files/figure-latex/efron-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:efron}A comparison of estimates from one block to the
those from all blocks shows the benefits of hierarchical regularization.
The bottom row shows sample estimates from one block; the middle row
shows the same from the hierarchical model; the top row shows sample
estimates from all the blocks. The shrinkage from the hierarchical model
attenuates the variability so that it matches that from much larger
samples.}
\end{figure}

The model-based one-block estimators are better predictors of the
overall data than are the sample one-block estimators. This improvement
may be formalized by a root-mean-squared error measure. The error is
about 1.60 times larger for the sample means than for the hierarchical
model estimates. This benefit is general---hierarchical models provide
for more accurate estimates of individuals latent abilities (James \&
Stein, 1961).

Figure~\ref{fig:efron} provides insight into the importability of sample
effect size measures. The problem here is that the variability of
individual sample effects are too large. That means the standard
deviation estimate is too large, and the resulting effect-size estimates
are too small. The model based estimates are regularized so that the
scale of individual effects is about right. Hence, the effect size
estimate is not systematically biased.

We can formalize the dynamics in play. It is helpful to express the
distribution of sample effects, \(d_i\) in model parameters. \[
d_i \sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_\theta,2\sigma^2/L + \sigma^2_\theta).
\] Classical effect size measure, \(\mbox{mean}(d)/\mbox{sd}(d)\), are
measuring \(\mu_\theta/\sqrt{2\sigma^2/L + \sigma^2_\theta}\). The
problem is the inclusion of \(2\sigma^2/L\), which is nuisance trial
variation. Not only does this included nuisance trial variation result
in individual effect estimates that are too variable and in effect size
measures that are too small, it violates portability as there is an
explicit dependence on \(L\), a sample-size measure. In the model-based
approach, the distribution of \(\theta_i\) is: \[
\theta_i \sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_\theta,\sigma^2_\theta),
\] and the effect size calculated from these individual effects are the
correct, portable, quantity.

It is now clear what the hierarchical model does---it accounts for
trial-by-trial variation. By doing so, results are portable to designs
with varying numbers of individuals and trials per individual. These
results are estimates of underlying properties of tasks.

\section{A Two-Task Model for Reliability and
Correlation}\label{a-two-task-model-for-reliability-and-correlation}

The hierarchical model may be expanded to account for two tasks or two
session simultaneously. For two sessions, the goal is to estimate a
portable measure of test-retest reliability; for two tasks, the goal is
to measure a portable estimate of correlation. Let's take reliability
first. The Hedge et al. data set, which we highlight here, has a novel
feature. These researchers sought to measure the test re-test
reliability of several cognitive tasks. They had individuals perform 720
trials of a task one day, and three weeks later the individuals returned
and performed another 720 trials. We let the subscript \(j=1,2\) index
the session. The trial-level model is expanded to: \[
Y_{ijk\ell} \sim \mbox{Normal}(\alpha_{ij}+x_k\theta_{ij},\sigma^2).
\] Here, we simply expand the parameters to hold for
individual-by-session combinations.

The parameters of interest are \(\theta_{ij}\) and there are several
specifications that may be made here. We start with the most general of
these, an additive-components decomposition into common and oppositional
components: \[
\begin{aligned}
\theta_{i1} &= \nu_1 + \omega_i - \gamma_i,\\
\theta_{i2} &= \nu_2 + \omega_i + \gamma_i.
\end{aligned}
\] The parameter \(\nu_j\) is the main effect of the \(j\)th session,
and by having separate main effect parameters for each session, the
model captures the possibility of a systematic effect of session on the
Stroop effect. The parameter \(\omega_i\) is the common effect of the
\(i\)th individual; individuals that have large Stroop effects on both
sessions have high values of \(\omega\). The parameter, \(\gamma_i\), is
the oppositional component. It captures idiosyncratic deviations where
one individual may have a large Stroop effect in one session and a
smaller one in another. Whereas these individual common effects and
oppositional effects are random effects, we place a hierarchical
constraint on them: \[
\begin{aligned}
\omega_i &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0,\sigma^2_\omega),\\
\gamma_i &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0,\sigma^2_\gamma).
\end{aligned}
\]

In the previous section, we constructed portable measures by focusing on
the distribution of \(\theta\), individuals' true effects. Here we do
the same. To gain an expression for the reliability of a task, it is
helpful to express the multivariate distribution of the \(\theta\)s. The
easiest way to do this is to write out the distribution for two
individuals' performance across two sessions: \[
\begin{bmatrix} \theta_{11} \\ \theta_{12} \\ \theta_{21} \\ \theta_{22} \end{bmatrix}
\sim \mbox{N}_4\left(
\begin{bmatrix} \nu_1 \\ \nu_2 \\ \nu_1 \\ \nu_2 \end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix} 
\sigma^2_\omega+\sigma^2_\gamma & \sigma^2_\omega-\sigma^2_\gamma& 0 & 0\\ 
\sigma^2_\omega-\sigma^2_\gamma & \sigma^2_\omega+\sigma^2_\gamma & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 &\sigma^2_\omega+\sigma^2_\gamma & \sigma^2_\omega-\sigma^2_\gamma \\ 
0 & 0 & \sigma^2_\omega-\sigma^2_\gamma & \sigma^2_\omega+\sigma^2_\gamma
\end{bmatrix}
\right)_.
\] From these distributions, it follows that the test-retest
reliability, the correlation across \(\theta_{i1}\) and \(\theta_{i2}\),
is \[
\rho = \frac{\sigma^2_\omega-\sigma^2_\gamma}{\sigma^2_\omega+\sigma^2_\gamma}
\] Importantly, this reliability is portable as it does not include
trial-by-trial variability.

To see where the importability of sample reliability comes from, we
start with the equivalent multivariate distribution for sample effects:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} d_{11} \\ d_{12} \\ d_{21} \\ d_{22} \end{bmatrix}
\sim \mbox{N}_4\left(
\begin{bmatrix} \nu_1 \\ \nu_2 \\ \nu_1 \\ \nu_2 \end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix} 
\sigma^2_\omega+\sigma^2_\gamma +2\sigma^2/L& \sigma^2_\omega-\sigma^2_\gamma & 0 & 0\\ 
\sigma^2_\omega-\sigma^2_\gamma & \sigma^2_\omega+\sigma^2_\gamma + 2\sigma^2/L& 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 &\sigma^2_\omega+\sigma^2_\gamma + 2\sigma^2/L& \sigma^2_\omega-\sigma^2_\gamma \\ 
0 & 0 & \sigma^2_\omega-\sigma^2_\gamma & \sigma^2_\omega+\sigma^2_\gamma + 2\sigma^2/L
\end{bmatrix}
\right)_.
\] From this distribution, it is clear that the sample correlation
between sample effects is estimating
\((\sigma^2_\omega-\sigma_\gamma)/(\sigma^2_\omega+\sigma^2_\gamma+2\sigma^2/L)\).
It is the added sample noise in the denominator, \(\sigma^2/L\), that
renders the sample test-retest reliability importable.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics{p_files/figure-latex/reliability-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:reliability}Test-retest reliability for Hedge et al.'s
Stroop-task data set. The top row shows analysis for one block per
session; the bottom row shows analysis for all blocks. The model
analyses show substantial correlation even with one block. When all the
data are considered the test-retest correlation is well localized for
satisfactorily high values.}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:reliability} provides a real-data comparison of
model-based and sample test-retest reliabilities. The top row is for the
single block of Hedge et al.'s Stroop task; the bottom row is for all
ten blocks of the same data set. The first column are scatter plots of
the sample effects of the first session vs.~the second session. There is
almost no test-retest correlation using a single block of data (A); but
when all data are considered there is a moderate correlation (B). This
pattern is the same as in Figure~\ref{fig:portability} where reliability
was diminished for smaller numbers of trials. The model estimates of
individual effects are shown in the middle column. Here, there is
shrinkage, especially for the single block (C,D). This shrinkage,
however, is to a line rather than to a point in the center. This pattern
reflects the model specification where positive and negative
correlations are explicitly modeled. The last column shows the posterior
distributions of the test-retest reliability coefficient. Here, for the
single-block data there is much uncertainty (E). The uncertainty shrinks
as the sample sizes grow, as indicated by the same plot for all the data
(F). The posterior mean, a point-estimate for the test-retest
reliability of the Stroop task, is 0.72. We also analyzed the flanker
task, and the test-retest reliability of this this task is 0.68. With
these relatively reasonable levels of reliability, there is sufficient
resolution to explore the correlation across the two tasks.

Figure~\ref{fig:reliability} highlights the dramatic difference between
conventional and hierarchical-model analysis, especially for smaller
numbers of trials per participant. If one uses the conventional model
for the reliability for one block of data, then the correlation
coefficient appears small, 0.10, and somewhat well localized (the 95\%
confidence interval is from-0.17 to 0.36). We emphasize this result is
misguided. When all the data are used, the conventional correlation
coefficient is 0.55, which is well outside this 95\% confidence
interval. Contrast this result to that from the hierarchical model.
Here, not only is the correlation coefficient larger, 0.31), but the
uncertainty is quite large as well (the 95\% credible interval is from
-0.31 to 0.80). Moreover, the value of the correlation from the
hierarchical model with all of the data, 0.72, is within this credible
interval. In summary, using the conventional analysis results in over
confidence in a wrong answer. The hierarchical model, however, tempers
this overconfidence by accounting for trial-by-trial uncertainty as well
as uncertainty across individuals.

Correlation between tasks may be handled with the same machinery. Here
we compare Stroop task performance to flanker task performance. Each of
Hedge et al's participants ran in both tasks. To correlate tasks, we
combined data across sessions and fit the model where \(j\) indexes task
rather than session. The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:combo}. As
can be seen, there appears to be no correlation. Inference about the
lack of correlation will be made in the next section where model
comparison is discussed.

\section{Model Comparison}\label{model-comparison}

The above analyses were focused on parameter estimation. With
estimation, the targets are the effect sizes and reliability of tasks,
and the correlation among tasks. Model-based estimation provided here
are portable analogs to sample-based measures of effect size,
reliability, and correlation. The difference is that they account for
variation at the trial level, and consequently, may be ported to designs
with varying sample sizes.

Researchers, however, are often interested in stating evidence for
theoretically meaningful propositions. In the next section, we describe
a set of theoretically meaningful propositions and their model
implementation. Following this, we present a Bayes factor method of
model comparison.

\subsection{Theoretical Positions and Model
Implementation}\label{theoretical-positions-and-model-implementation}

When assessing the relationship between two tasks, the main target is
the correlation. The above estimation model is helpful for estimating
the correlation, but often researchers are interested in the following
statements: The first one is about a lack of correlation among two
tasks. A lack of correlation is a necessary condition for independence,
and if there is evidence for a lack of correlation, then independence is
plausible. The state is full correlation among the tasks. If there is
full correlation, then there is evidence that both tasks are measuring a
single dimension or ability.

In the preceding section, we presented an estimation model, which we now
call the \emph{general model}. The critical specification is that of
\(\theta_{ij}\), the individual-by-task effect. We modeled these as:
\[ \begin{aligned}
\calM_g: \quad & \theta_{ij}=\nu_j+\omega_i+u_j\gamma_i,\\
& \omega_i \sim \mbox{Normal}(0,\sigma^2_\omega),\\
& \gamma_i \sim \mbox{Normal}(0,\sigma^2_\gamma),
\end{aligned}
\] where \(u=(-1,1)\) for the two tasks. In this model, the correlation
among an individuals reflects the variability of \(\omega\) and
\(\gamma\). All values of correlation on the open interval (-1,1) are
possible. Full correlation is not possible, and there is no special
credence given to no correlation. To represent those positions we
develop alternative models on \(\theta{ij}\).

A no-correlation model is given by putting uncorrelated noise on
\(\theta_{ij}\): \[
\begin{aligned}
\calM_0: \quad & \theta_{ij} \sim \mbox{Normal}(\nu_j,\sigma^2_\theta).
\end{aligned}\]

The no-correlation and the general models provide for different
constraints. The general model has regularization to a regression line
reflected by the balance of the variabilities of \(\omega\) and
\(\gamma\). The no-correlation has regularization to the point
\((\nu_1,\nu_2)\).

A full correlation model is given by simply omitting the \(\gamma\)
parameters in the general model. \[
\begin{aligned}
\calM_1: \quad & \theta_{ij}=\nu_j+\omega_i,\\
& \omega_i \sim \mbox{Normal}(0,\sigma^2_\theta)
\end{aligned}
\] Here, there is a single random parameter, \(\omega_i\) for both
tasks.

Before continuing to model comparison, a more in-depth consideration of
priors on parameters is needed. In Bayesian analysis, priors are needed
for all parameters. In the preceding sections, we de-emphasized the role
of the prior. For estimating parameters, the influence of the priors
quickly diminishes with increasing sample sizes (Lee, 1997). In our
context, we had a large number of observations, and the reported
estimates are very robust to large changes in prior settings. For model
comparison, however, the story changes markedly. Priors play a critical
role and must be set judiciously. In the Appendix, under the section on
Prior Specification, we discuss the role of prior settings and justify
our choices. We encourage all readers to read the Appendix though it is
not necessary to continue.

\subsection{Bayes Factor}\label{bayes-factor}

In Bayesian analysis, it is possible to use Bayes' rule to update
beliefs about the plausibility of models themselves. Let \(\calM_a\) and
\(\calM_b\) be two models under consideration and let \(\bfY\) denote a
collection of observations. The relevant equation is: \[
\frac{P(\calM_a|\bfY)}{P(\calM_b|\bfY)} = \frac{P(\bfY|\calM_a)}{P(\bfY|\calM_b)} \times \frac{P(\calM_a)}{P(\calM_b)}.
\] Here \({P(\calM_a|\bfY)}/{P(\calM_b|\bfY)}\) are the posterior odds
on the models; \(P(\calM_a)/P(\calM_b)\) are the prior odds, and
\(P(\bfY|\calM_a)/P(\bfY|\calM_b)\) is the Bayes factor. This factor
describes how odds should be updated in light of data. A growing chorus
of psychologists and statisticians argue that the Bayes factor is ideal
for scientific communication because it is the updating factor
regardless of whatever prior odds are held (Edwards et al., 1963;
Jeffreys, 1961; Myung \& Pitt, 1997; Wagenmakers, 2007). The Bayes
factor may also be thought of as describing how well the model predicts
the observed data (Morey, Romeijn, \& Rouder, 2016; Rouder, Haaf, \&
Aust, 2018; Rouder, Morey, \& Wagenmakers, 2016). Models in the Bayesian
context provide a predictive probability distribution across the data,
that is, they describe where the data should lie before seeing them.
Then, we assess how well each model predicted the observed data.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:bftab} shows the Bayes factor results for a few data sets
from Hedge et al. (2018). The top two rows are for the Stroop and
flanker data, and the correlation being tested is the test-retest
reliability. The posterior mean of the correlation coefficients are 0.72
and 0.68, for the Stroop and flanker tasks, respectively. The Bayes
factors confirm that there is ample evidence that the correlation is
neither null nor full. Hence, we may conclude that there is indeed some
though not a lot of added variability between the first and second
sessions in these tasks. The next row shows the correlation between the
two tasks. Here, the posterior mean of the correlation coefficient is
-0.06 and the Bayes factors confirm that the no-correlation model is
preferred. The final row is a demonstration of the utility of the
approach for finding dimension reductions. Here, we split the flanker
task data in half by odd and even trials rather than by sessions. We
then submitted these two sets to the model, and calculated the
correlation. It was quite high of course, and the posterior mean of the
correlation was 0.82. The Bayes factor analysis concurred, and the
full-correlation model was favored by 31-to-1 over the general model,
the nearest competitor.

The Appendix provides the prior settings for the above analyses. It also
provides a series of alternative settings for assessing how sensitive
Bayes factors are to reasonable variation in priors. With these
alternative settings, the Bayes factors attain different values.
Table~\ref{tab:sens} in the Appendix shows the range of Bayes factors
corresponding to these alternative settings. This table provides context
for understanding the limits of the data and the diversity of opinion
they support.

\section{General Discussion}\label{general-discussion}

In this paper we examined classical test theory analysis of experimental
tasks. In the classical-test-theory framework, conventional sample
measures are not portable because they are estimating quantities
contaminated by removable trial-by-trial variation. With this
contamination, effect sizes reliabilities, and correlations are
dramatically too low. The main innovation here is modeling
trial-by-trial variation along with individuals' covariation across
tasks. Concepts such as effect size, reliability, and correlation are
portable when defined in the asymptotic limit of unbounded trials per
individual. In the current models, performance in these asymptotic
limits are explicit model parameters.

With this development, it is possible to assess whether observed low
correlations across tasks reflect low reliability or a true lack of
association. We examine this problem for the Stroop and flanker task
data reported in Hedge et al. (2018). We find that there is relatively
high test-retest reliability for both tasks. This high reliability
allows for the interpretation of the correlation between Stroop and
flanker tasks. There is direct evidence for a null correlation.

The main difficulty in classical analysis occurs when researchers
aggregate across trials to form individual-by-task scores. We recommend
that researcher avoid this aggregation. Instead, they should extend
hierarchical models to the trial level, and by doing so, classical
concepts of reliability, effect size, and correlation remain meaningful
and portable. Individual-difference researchers are intimately familiar
with mixed linear models, and these are used regularly to decompose
variability. Adding one additional level, the trial level, is
conceptually trivial and computationally straightforward. Indeed,
modeling at this level is common in high-stakes testing (IRT, Lord \&
Novick, 1968), cognition (Lee \& Webb, 2005; Rouder \& Lu, 2005), and
linguistics (Baayen et al., 2002).

\subsection{Bayesian Modeling}\label{bayesian-modeling}

The models presented here are simple hierarchical models, and
consequently, they may be analyzed in conventional or Bayesian
frameworks. For parameter estimation, there is often little difference
between Bayesian approaches and more classical ones. Bayesian approaches
make latent variable modeling a bit simpler and more conceptually
straightforward (Gelman et al., 2004), but the regularized estimates
from hierarchical models behave similarly in both frameworks (Lehmann \&
Casella, 1998).

The big difference between conventional and Bayesian latent-variable
modeling, at least for the methods we ascribe to, is in model
comparison. There are several different Bayesian approaches to model
comparison. We advocate comparison by Bayes factor, but other approaches
include using the coverage of credible intervals (Kruschke \& Liddell,
2017), comparison by deviance information criterion (DIC; Spiegelhalter,
Best, Carlin, \& Linde, 2002), and comparison through cross validation
(Vehtari, Gelman, \& Gabry, 2017). The reason we prefer Bayes factor is
that it follows directly from Bayes' rule (Laplace, 1986) and uniquely
guarantees rational updating of the plausibility of models in light of
data (de Finetti, 1974). Other methods necessarily do not update
rationally. Instead, they meet other desiderata, mostly focused either
on out-of-sample considerations or minimizing the influence of prior
settings. The debate among Bayesians about model comparison is certainly
vigorous and well litigated. As a matter of principle, we advocate Bayes
factor as a rational updater. Simultaneously, we respect that others may
invoke alternative desiderata, and we appreciate their critiques. Those
who use Bayes factor should be prepared to admit a diversity of opinion
that reflects the range of reasonable prior settings, as we do in the
Appendix.

\subsection{More Advanced Task Models}\label{more-advanced-task-models}

The field of individual differences has moved far beyond the
consideration of two tasks or instruments. The field is dominated by
multivariate, latent-variable models including factor models, structural
equation models, state-space models, and growth models (e.g., Bollen,
1989). When task scores are used with these advanced models, the results
are importable and, consequently, difficult to interpret unless
trial-by-trial variation is modeled. A critical question is whether the
hierarchical models specified here extend well beyond two tasks. The
generalization, at least for estimation, is straightforward. Bayesian
development of latent variable models is a burgeoning field (Lee, 2007).
Moreover, because Bayesian analysis explicitly allows for conditional
rather than marginal expressions, adding covariance models is
conceptually straightforward. Computational issues have been well
explored, and general-purpose packages such as Stan (Carpenter et al.,
2017) and JAGS (Plummer, 2003) are well suited to developing advanced
latent variable models that account for trial-by-trial variation.

Although some forms of analysis are straightforward in Bayesian
latent-variable modeling, Bayes-factor model comparison is not among
these. Developing Bayes factors for complicated mixed models is
certainly timely and topical, but the computational issues may be
difficult. As a result, there is much work to be done if one wishes to
state the evidence for theoretically motivated constraints on
covariation across several tasks.

\subsection{A Caveat}\label{a-caveat}

In the beginning of this paper, we asked if low correlations reflect
statistical considerations or substantive considerations. The answer
here, with a large data set, is that there is a substantive claim. We
state positive evidence for a lack of correlation across Stroop and
flanker tasks. That said, the better answer to our initial question is
\enquote{Yes.} Yes, the attenuated correlations have substantive
meaning, and, yes, there are difficult statistical considerations.

We suspect there is far less true individual variability in many tasks
than has been realized, and apparent variability comes more from the
trial level than from true individual differences. Consider a typical
priming task. Trials in these tasks take about 500 ms to complete, and a
large effect is about 50 ms. If the average is 50 ms, how much could
individuals truly vary? The answer is \enquote{not that much,}
especially if we assume that no individual has true negative effects
(Haaf \& Rouder, 2017; Rouder \& Haaf, 2018). Indeed, we have analyzed
the observed and true (latent) variation across individuals in many
tasks (Haaf \& Rouder, 2017, 2018). Observed variation is usually on the
order of 100s of milliseconds. Yet, once trial-by-trial variation is
modeled, individuals' true values vary from 10 ms to 40 ms. For such a
narrow range, accurate understanding of individuals would require
estimating each individual's effect to within a few milliseconds. Even
the hierarchical models we advocate cannot mitigate this fact; if there
is too little resolution then the posterior reliabilities and
correlations will not be well localized. Obtaining the requisite level
of resolution requires several hundred trials per individual per
condition. It may be that these types of small-effect tasks have too
small a range of individual differences to be useful in
individual-difference research without large-scale data collection
efforts.

\section{Appendix}\label{appendix}

\subsection{Prior settings}\label{prior-settings}

Priors are needed on models, and the specification of these priors plays
a critical role in Bayes factor model comparison. Some of the parameters
are common to all the models under consideration. For Models
\(\calM_g\), \(\calM_0\), and \(\calM_1\), the common parameters are
\(\sigma^2\), the collection of all \(\alpha_{ij}\), and the two
\(\nu_j\). For these parameters, the priors have a marginal effect on
model comparison so long as they are not overly constraining. Other
parameters---the ones that define the differences between the
models---are critical, and their priors must be set judiciously. The
three models are defined by different specifications of \(\theta_{ij}\),
and the priors on the related parameters need careful consideration. In
the general model, these parameters are \(\sigma^2_\omega\) and
\(\sigma^2_\gamma\). In the zero-correlation and full correlation model,
the parameters are \(\sigma^2_\theta\) and \(\sigma^2_\omega\),
respectively. It is popular to express these variabilities as multiples
of the trial-by-trial variability (Zellner, 1986; Zellner \& Siow,
1980). Let \(g_\omega=\sigma^2_\omega/\sigma^2\),
\(g_\gamma=\sigma^2_\gamma/\sigma^2\), and
\(g_\theta=\sigma^2_\theta/\sigma^2\). Then, priors on the \(g\)
parameters are often scaled inverse-\(\chi^2\) distributions (Liang,
Paulo, Molina, Clyde, \& Berger, 2008; Overstall \& Forster, 2010;
Rouder, Morey, Speckman, \& Province, 2012): \[
\begin{aligned}
g_\omega &\sim \mbox{inverse-$\chi^2$}(1,r^2_\omega),\\
g_\gamma &\sim \mbox{inverse-$\chi^2$}(1,r^2_\gamma),\\
g_\theta &\sim \mbox{inverse-$\chi^2$}(1,r^2_\theta),\\
\end{aligned}
\] where there is a single degree of freedom for each distribution, and
scales of \(r^2_\omega\), \(r^2_\gamma\), and \(r^2_\theta\). The scaled
inverse-\(\chi^2\) is chosen because it makes the ensuing Bayes factor
computations convenient and, additionally, it leads to inference that
has strong objective Bayes properties (Berger, 2006; Liang et al.,
2008). For example, it may be shown that with this choice the Bayes
factor goes to appropriate extremes as sample sizes increase or as the
data becomes less and less variable.

The critical issue is the setting of scale constants: \(r^2_\omega\),
\(r^2_\gamma\), and \(r^2_\theta\). At first glance, setting these
constants seems arbitrary. More alarming, the Bayes factor model
comparisons will depend on these settings. It is for this reason---that
seemingly arbitrary settings have big impacts on inference--- that
Gelman \& Carlin (2017) are skeptical about the usefulness of Bayes
factors. Here we justify our settings. Subsequently, we will explore the
sensitivity of inference to reasonable variations in these settings.

As substantive scientist we have background knowledge of how variable
effects tend to be in comparable experiments. In a typical Stroop or
flanker experiment, the trial-to-trial standard deviation is somewhere
around 200 ms to 300 ms. Hedge et al. (2018) had particularly fast and
error prone responses in their data set, and as a result, we take the
200 ms value to help set prior scale constants. A healthy Stroop or
flanker effect here would be about 50 ms, or 0.25 of the trial-to-trial
standard deviation. The next question is how much do we think people
could possible vary in each task. We chose 33.33 ms or \(r_\theta=\)
0.17 of the trial-to-trial standard deviation, and this value was used
in both the full correlation and no correlation models. To set
\(r_\omega\) and \(r_\gamma\), we equated the bivariate variances
between the general model and no correlation model and chose
\(r_\gamma\) to be 0.67 of \(r_\omega\). The reason we chose this ratio
is that we \emph{a priori} expect some positive covariation across the
tasks. With these choices, the value of \(r_\omega\)=0.14 and the value
of \(r_\gamma\)=0.10.

Figure~\ref{fig:prior}A shows the prior on standard deviations
\(\sigma_\theta\), \(\sigma_\omega\) and \(\sigma_\gamma\) based on
these choices. As can be seen, although the priors have scales, their
flexibility comes from their slow, fat right tails.

The next panel, Figure~\ref{fig:prior}B shows how these choices specify
a prior over correlation, \(\rho\), in the general model. The
distribution is \(u\)-shaped which is reasonable for priors on bounded
spaces (Jaynes, 1986). The slight weight toward positive correlations
reflects the choice that \(r_\omega>r_\gamma\). Had these two settings
been equal, then there would be no slight weight toward positive and
negative values. If \(r_\omega<r_\gamma\), the weight is toward negative
values.

\subsection{Sensitivity to Prior
Specification}\label{sensitivity-to-prior-specification}

One issue is that Bayes factor values are dependent on prior
specification. A few points of context are helpful in understanding this
dependence. It seems reasonable to expect that if two researchers run
the same experiment and obtain the same data, then they should reach
similar conclusions. To meet this expectation, many Bayesian analysts
actively seek to minimize this dependence by picking likelihoods, prior
parametric forms, and heuristic methods of inference so that variation
in prior settings have minimal influence (Aitkin, 1991; Gelman \&
Shalizi, 2013; Kruschke, 2012; Spiegelhalter et al., 2002). In the
context of these views, the dependence of prior settings on inference is
viewed negatively; not only is it something to be avoided, it is a
threat to the validity of Bayesian analysis.

We reject this expectation that minimization of prior effects is
necessary or even laudable. Rouder et al. (2016) argue that the goal of
analysis is to add value by searching for theoretically-meaningful
structure in data. Vanpaemel (2010) and Vanpaemel \& Lee (2012) provide
a particularly appealing view of the prior in this light. Accordingly,
the prior is where theoretically important constraint is encoded in the
model. When different researchers use different priors, they are testing
different theoretical constraints, and not surprisingly, they will reach
different opinions about the data. Rouder et al. (2016) argue that this
variation is not problematic in fact it should be expected and seen
positively. Methods that are insensitive to different theoretical
commitments are not very useful. Rouder et al. (2016) recommend that so
long as various prior settings are justifiable, the variation in results
should be embraced as the legitimate diversity of opinion. When
reasonable prior settings result in conflicting conclusions, we realize
the data do not afford the precision to adjudicate among the positions.

The critical prior specifications in the models are the settings
\(r_\theta\), \(r_\omega\), and \(r_\gamma\). How does the Bayes factor
change if we make other reasonable choices? Let's start by noting that
about a 50 ms effect is reasonably expected. We cannot imagine
individual variation being so large as to have a standard deviation much
greater than this value. If say the true value of \(\sigma_\theta\) was
50 ms, it would imply that 14\% of individuals have true negative Stroop
or flanker effects, which seems implausible. Likewise, we cant imagine
variation being smaller than say 10 ms across people. These values, 10
ms and 50 ms, inform a bracket of reasonable settings for \(r_\theta\).

The same approach works for finding reasonable ranges for the ratio of
\(r_\gamma/r_\omega\). The chosen value was 0.67 meaning that mildly
positive correlations were expected. We think a reasonable range for
this ratio is from a high value of 1.0 to a low value of 1/3. The value
of 1.0 corresponds to as great a chance of negative correlation as
positive, which is the bottom limit on the possible reasonable ranges of
correlation for tasks that purportedly tap the same underlying
construct. The value of 1/3 sets a lofty expectation of positive
correlation. We cannot imagine settings greater than or less than these
values would be reasonable for the general model.

Table~\ref{tab:sens} shows how variation in prior settings resulted
variation of the Bayes factors. The first three columns show the
settings for \(r_\theta\), \(r_\omega\), and \(r_\gamma\). The next two
columns show Bayes factors for the winning model for two cases. The
first is the correlation between the Stroop and flanker task, and the
Bayes factor is by how much the null-correlation model is preferred over
the general model. The second is the correlation among even and odd
trials in the flanker task, and the Bayes factor is by how much the
full-correlation model is preferred over the general model. As can be
see, the prior settings do matter. Take the correlation between the
Stroop and flanker tasks. The null correlation model wins in all cases,
but the value ranges from about 5-to-1 to about 11-to-1 over the general
model. These are relatively stable results bolstering the claim that
there is evidence for a lack of correlation. For the high reliability
case, the full correlation model wins in all cases, but the Bayes factor
values are quite variable, from 3-to-1 to 176-to-1. Here we are less
sanguine because the evidence is more dependent on prior assumptions.
Had we taken a larger bracket, the model preferences may have even
reversed. While we may favor a full correlation model, that preference
should be tempered and made with caution.
